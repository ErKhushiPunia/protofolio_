          <p class=" textSmall">As a teenager at school, I was the kid other students approached about issues with their phone or laptop. Today, not much has changed. I am a programmer, I am learning C and C++ programming languages.
            I am a computer science engineering student at Swami Keshvanand Institute of Technology, Management & Gramothan, jaipur. Due to graduate in the coming months, I am eager to secure challenging roles in computer science engineering. I am eager to hear about potential career opportunities, so I would be pleased to chat about job openings in the engineering sphere.
            
            My key skills include: Communication, Dedication, Eagerness to take Challenges, Learn new things and good listener, good problem solving skills, good at understanding new concepts.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag textSmall">C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972. It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system. The main features of the C language include low-level memory access, a simple set of keywords, and a clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler development. </p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag textSmall">C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and a compiled language. C++ is a middle-level language rendering it the advantage of programming low-level (drivers, kernels) and even higher-level applications (games, GUI, desktop apps etc.). The basic syntax and code structure of both C and C++ are the same. </p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag textSmall">HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design web pages using a markup language. HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. Hypertext defines the link between the web pages. A markup language is used to define the text document within tag which defines the structure of web pages. This language is used to annotate (make notes for the computer) text so that a machine can understand it and manipulate text accordingly. Most markup languages (e.g. HTML) are human-readable. The language uses tags to define what manipulation has to be done on the text. </p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag textSmall">Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page.
          CSS is easy to learn and understood, but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag textSmall">JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted scripting language. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag textSmall">Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code. Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.</p>
